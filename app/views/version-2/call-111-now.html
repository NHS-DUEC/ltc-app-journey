            <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-xl" data-test-id="outcome-heading">You need to speak to a health adviser</h1>
              <p>We cannot complete your assessment online. You need to speak to a health adviser to get the right help.</p>

              <p>Calling 111 from this screen means:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          you will speak to someone more quickly than dialling 111 from your keypad
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          your personal details (name, postcode, NHS number) will be sent
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          the health adviser will know your main symptom
                      </li>
                     
                  </ul>
              <p>The health adviser will ask you to confirm details such as your name. You will also have to answer some more questions about your symptoms.</p>
